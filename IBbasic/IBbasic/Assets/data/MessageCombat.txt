<yl>COMBAT</yl>
<gn>1. Player's Turn:</gn> Each player takes a turn. The current player will be highlighted with a light blue box. You can Move one square (or stay put) and make one additional action such as ATTACK, CAST, use item, or end turn (SKIP button).
<gn>2. Info Mode:</gn> Info mode is the default mode. In this mode you can tap on a token (player or enemy image) to show some of their stats (HP, SP, etc.). If none of the buttons are highlighted, then you are in 'Info' mode. If you are in 'move' mode and want to return to 'info' mode, tap on the move button to unselect it and return to 'info' mode. Same concept works for 'attack' mode back to 'info' mode.

<gn>4. Cast:</gn> After pressing cast and selecting a spell from the spell selection screen, move the target selection square by pressing the arrow keys or tapping on any map square.

<gn>5. Skip:</gn> The 'SKIP' button will end the current player's turn.
